I'm a developer with a strong interest in understanding how systems work across software, hardware, and the layers in between

My background is primarily in **backend web development**, working with frameworks such as **Django** and **Flask**, alongside **database administration** using **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. I'm currently deepening my PostgreSQL expertise, with a focus on how database behave under real-world workloads.

I also work cross data pipelines i.e., **data collection and scraping, cleaning, transformation, and analysis**, with an emphasis on building reliable and maintainable workflows rather than one-off scripts.

I have experience in **systems administration**, working comfortably in Linux environments and actively exploring Windows PowerShell to broaden my cross-platform understanding.

Alongside this, I'm expanding into **Java** as preparation for deeper work in **Android security**. I already have a solid grounding in **web security**, and my exploration of Java, Android, and low-level languages is driven by a desire to better understand security at the system, platform, and hardware level.

My interests in **low-level programming**, **embeded systems**, and hardware stem from the same motivation: building a stronger mental model of how systems operate beneath abstractions and how they can fail, be secured, or be exploited.

This blog is a space where I document what I'm building, what I'm learning, and how I think through technical problems. The focus is on hands-on experimentation, practical systems thinking, and lessons learned from working within real constraints.

I write primarily for engineers, developers, and technical curious readers who care about how things actually work.
